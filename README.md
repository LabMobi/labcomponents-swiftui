# Mobi Lab Components for Compose

Mobi Lab Components for SwiftUI (`LabComponents`) help developers execute our internal design system's components on the iOS platform.

The components provide implementations for [Mobi Lab's design system](https://www.figma.com/file/gxt4iyWGyliILJSOCLXonl/P42-design-system-template?type=design&node-id=1652-14713&mode=design&t=j4TbnOpahS3korsT-0)

## Description

The library contains a ready-to-use SwiftUI implementation of the components from Mobi Lab's design system. Mobi Lab's design system allows teams to focus on solving business problems instead of reinventing basic design system and UI components at the design and implementation phases.

The project consists of the component library in `sources` module.
